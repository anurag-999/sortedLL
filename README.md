# Sorted Linked List Project

This project implements a sorted linked list in C++. A sorted linked list is a data structure where elements are stored in a sorted order, and insertion of new elements maintains the sorted property of the list.

## Overview

This project consists of two main components:

1.  **Node Structure**: Defines a structure `Node` that represents a single element in the linked list. Each node contains an integer value (`data`) and a pointer to the next node (`next`).
    
2.  **SortedLinkedList Class**: Implements a sorted linked list using the `Node` structure. The `SortedLinkedList` class provides methods to insert elements into the list while ensuring that the elements remain sorted, and to display the elements of the list.
    

## Features

-   **Insertion**: New elements can be inserted into the sorted linked list while preserving the sorted order.
-   **Display**: The elements of the sorted linked list can be displayed in ascending order.
